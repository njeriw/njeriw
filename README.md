## Hi there üëã
I'm Njeri (she/her) - I‚Äôm an aspiring data scientist, currently pursuing my Master's degree at The Georgia Institute of Technology. My interests include Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and MLOps. Here, you'll find my projects, experiments, and ongoing learning experiences as I dive deeper into the world of data.

## Project Highlights
#### [**Credit Risk Modeling - Lending Club**](https://github.com/njeriw/CreditRiskModeling)
* Description: This project focuses on building a threat detection system using the BETH dataset, a real-world collection of cybersecurity data for anomaly detection. I leveraged PyTorch to develop a deep learning model for classifying suspicious activities and Bayesian optimization to optimize the model's performance and hyper-parameters.
#### [**AutoML with Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT)**](https://github.com/njeriw/AutoML)
* Description: This project explores an automated machine learning (AutoML) technique to efficiently and automatically discover high-performing machine learning pipelines for a classification task. The pipeline automates model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
#### [**Cybersecurity Threat Detection**](https://github.com/njeriw/CybersecurityThreatDetection)
* Description: This project focuses on developing models for loan status and credit risk assessment. Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, notable integrating textual features through the exploration of two distinct word embedding techniques: Word2Vec for static representations and BERT for advanced contextual embeddings
